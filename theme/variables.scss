// Named Color Variables
// --------------------------------------------------
// Named colors makes it easy to reuse colors on various components.
// It's highly recommended to change the default colors
// to match your app's branding. Ionic uses a Sass map of
// colors so you can add, rename and remove colors as needed.
// The "primary" color is the only required color in the map.

$colors: (
  primary: #00A6FF,
  secondary: #0074B2,
  danger: #FF3900,
  warning: #FFBA00,
  light: #34B6FC,
  dark: #005887
);
